Visualization
=============

Just started out using this and I hope to get better with my Javascript skills.
This is a Music Visualization. 

Red Cube changes length, 
Blue Cube changes height,
Yellow changes width,
Green scales size

Im hoping to make particles when the cubes hit the  sphere with collistion detection.
I want to implement a time for those particles so it will disappear.
Any insight would be appreciated.

I am using the song Pulses by Karmin for the code to read music data.
